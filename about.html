  <p>
    Hello! I'm Hashir Ahmed, a dedicated and curious developer in the making. I started my programming journey with the basics of Python and Java, which gave me a solid understanding of logic, syntax, and fundamental programming concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm exploring the exciting world of web development. Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design clean and responsive user interfaces. At the same time, I'm working on improving my JavaScript skills to bring interactivity to websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also learning modern technologies like TypeScript and React, which help build dynamic and scalable web applications. Every day is a new opportunity for me to learn something new, solve a new problem, or improve what I already know.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, visually appealing websites and web apps. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, combining front-end creativity with back-end logic. I enjoy learning through building projects, exploring real-world use cases, and keeping up with the latest trends in technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm excited about the journey ahead and always open to learning, growing, and collaborating!
